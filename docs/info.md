## How it works

This design implements a 4-bit synchronous counter.

The counter increments its value on every rising edge of the clock signal.
The clock is provided through ui_in[0].

When reset (rst_n) is low, the counter is cleared to 0.

The counter output is mapped to uo_out[3:0].

## How to test

1. Apply reset (rst_n = 0) to initialize the counter.
2. Release reset (rst_n = 1).
3. Toggle ui_in[0] to generate a clock signal.
4. Observe the output on uo_out[3:0].

The output should increment in binary:
0000 → 0001 → 0010 → ... → 1111 → 0000
